# Jarsoft Contributing Guidelines

Keep in mind that these guidelines apply to both _internal_ and _public_ repositories.

We're happy that you have interest in contributing to the organization. However, we're likely not able to accept general contributions, so your pull-request may be closed and not merged, even if it's well constructed. Contact the maintainers of the specific repository you're interested in by making an issue _before_ starting to make a contribution.

# Beginning

The procedure of getting started with a repository on your local machine & submitting your changes differs from repository to repository. Make sure you check the actual repository `README.md` you're working on for detailed setup instructions.

# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (_"the CLA"_) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, check the `CLA.md` file by visiting https://github.com/jarsft/.github/blob/production/agreements/CLA.md.

When you submit a pull-request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether or not you need to agree to the CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). If available, follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using the Jarsoft CLA.

Unless stated otherwise, all projects (whether _internal_ or _public_) adopt the [Jarsoft Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jarsft/.github/blob/production/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
