## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

The projects distributed by Jarsoft aim to be as secure as possible in every possible way. If you've discovered a security vulnerability within any of our projects, we ask you to disclose it to us in a [responsible manner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure). Please do not file any Github issues for the issue.

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the organization's projects at risk. If you've discovered a security concern, please send us [an email](mailto:security@jar.run,system@jar.run?subject=%5BJARSOFT-SECURITY%5D) describing the issue. We'll work with you to make sure we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address the concern.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as possble) to help us further understand the issue:

* Type of issue.
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue.
* Repository location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL).
* Any special configurations requried to reproduce the issue.
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code.
* Impact of the issue & how it may be exploited by attackers.

After a security vulnerability has been corrected, a security hotfix release will be deployed as soon as possible.
