# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The projects distributed by Jarsoft aim to be as secure as possible in every possible way. If you've discovered a security vulnerability within any section of our products, we ask you to disclose it to us in a [responsible manner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the organization's projects at risk. If you've discovered a security concern, please send us [an email](mailto:security@jar.run,system@jar.run?subject=%5BJARSOFT-SECURITY%5D) describing the issue. We'll work with you to make sure we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address the concern.

After a security vulnerability has been corrected, a security hotfix release will be deployed as soon as possible.
