                      We've received your pull-request, but it looks like this may be your first contribution to a Jarsoft project. Before we can merge your pull-request, you'll need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) allowing Jarsoft (or for public repositories, the public) to use your changes.

                      * See the [CLA document here](https://github.com/jarsft/.github/blob/production/agreements/CLA.md) for details.

                      Reply with the phrase at the bottom of this comment to sign the CLA & to proceed with the merge. If you've already signed the CLA, comment `recheck`, the workflow will automatically re-run & re-check your signature status.
                  # custom-pr-sign-comment: 'I have read the CLA document and hereby sign & accept the CLA agreement'
                  custom-allsigned-prcomment: '**CLA Status** - All contributors have signed the CLA.'
                  # lock-pullrequest-aftermerge: false - if you don't want this bot to automatically lock the pull request after merging (default - true)
                  # use-dco-flag: true - If you are using DCO instead of CLA

                      exist, the **pull-request can be successfully merged.**
